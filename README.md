# OldStyle_Scales

this is a project for give life back to an old mechanical scales.

The BOM for this prject is:
- 1 weight scales(10KG);
- 1 ADC converter for weight scales(HX711 IC);
- 1 0/1 switch button;
- 1 micro push button;
- 1 LCD 16X2;
- 1 arduino CPU(arduino micro);
- 1 battery pack

- cables, watertight welder, 3D printer, spray paint, ecc....


hardly the old scale that I used will be the same as yours so you will need a lot of imagination to adapt your scale in my style.
i share some photo to have an idea on what i've done.

if you use the same electronic, you can use my arduino project(only need to recalibrate the scales with your hardware).
thanks to HX711 library of Bogdan..... that you need to download for use my arduino project.
