# OldStyle_Scales

this is a project for give life back to an old mechanical scales.

The BOM for this prject is:
- 1 weight scales(10KG);
- 1 ADC converter for weight scales(HX711 IC);
- 1 0/1 switch button;
- 1 micro push button;
- 1 LCD 16X2;
- 1 arduino CPU(arduino micro);
- 1 battery pack

- cables, watertight welder, resistors, capacitors, 3D printer, spray paint, ecc....


hardly the old scale that I used will be the same as yours so you will need a lot of imagination to adapt your scale in my style.
i share some photo to have an idea on what i've done.

if you use the same electronic, you can use my arduino project(only need to recalibrate the scales with your hardware).
thanks to HX711 library of Bogdan..... that you need to download for use my arduino project.


...upgrade...
next upgrade will be the battery pack. now there is 2 lithium cell in parallel with an old powerbank circuit card. the problem is that the consumption of the system is very low and the battery bank close the power after some second. to resolve the issue i have put a resistor to increase the consumption of the system.
i also have order a new lithium battery charger(TP4056) and a steup up converter so i cn charge in security the cell and increase the volt to 5V for the scales hardware components and remove the old power bank circuit and resistor.
